# Data Types in C

  - Signed Char, byte

  - Unsigned Char, byte

  - Signed Short, word

  - Unsigned Short, word

  - Signed 32 Integer, double words, dwods

  - Unsigned 32 Integer, double words, dwods

  - Unsigned 64 Integer, double words, dwods

  - Unsigned 64 Integer, double words, dwods

  - Float (imprecise but infinite range)

  - Double

## Signed Int

The `int` data type is used for variables that will store `integers`.

Integers always take up `4 bytes` of memory `32 bits`.

This means the range of values `int` can store is limited to `32 bits` worth information.


` Integer range : -2 ** 31 to 2 ** 31 - 1`

## Unsigned Int

`unsigned`is a qualifier that can be applied to certain types (including `int`), which effectively doubles the positive range of variables of that type, at the cost of disallowing any negative values.

` Unsigned Integer range : 0 to 2 ** 32 - 1`
